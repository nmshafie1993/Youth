# Project Goal
In this project, we aim to show youthâ€™s poor grades do not mean that they are lazy or dumb. Often times, they mean a deeper problem is going on that parents are unaware of. Using the students answers to behavioral questions on YRBSS dataset, we were able to predict the students grades. 
#### Data Source Citation: 
The data has been obtained from Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS). <br>

The surveys conducted between 1991 and 2017 and filled by male and female youth between 12-18. <br>
